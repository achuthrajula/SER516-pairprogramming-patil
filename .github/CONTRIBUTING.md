### Code conventions
We follow practices including Test Driven Development (red/green/refactor), so we strongly encourage you to test drive your code. 

If you commit code and make a pull request, it will be reviewed by a trusted committer according to our code/styling/testing standards.

### Fork and Pull
For this repo we use a standard Fork and Pull contributing model.  This is a good way to manage multiple, asynchronous contributors.  Follow the steps in [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and you'll be on your way.

After forking, remember to set up a remote that points to the upstream repository to keep your forked repo up-to-date. [This article](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) goes through the steps of syncing your fork.

When you are ready to merge your change back in, open a pull request!
